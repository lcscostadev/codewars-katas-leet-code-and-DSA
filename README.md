# Codewars Katas
This is a repository for coding problems using codewars website to see my programming-logic evolution with JavaScript, this Repo will also contain, problems in C and Python exercises from my college.

## Data Strucures

BigO, Linked Lists, Arrays, Strings, Recursive DS, Iterative DS

## Algorithms

BubbleSort, SelectionSort, Fibonacci, Factorial

## Roadmap

Here goes a roadmap that im following to become a better logic developer:

1. Basic data structures:
    - Arrays and linked lists: A few weeks to a few months
    - Stacks and queues: A few weeks to a few months
    - Hash tables: A few weeks to a few months
    - Trees (binary search trees, heaps, etc.): A few weeks to a few months
    - Graphs: A few months to a year
2. Basic algorithms:
    - Searching algorithms (linear search, binary search): A few weeks
    - Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quicksort): A few weeks to a few months
    - Recursion: A few weeks
    - Dynamic programming: A few months
    - Greedy algorithms: A few months
3. Advanced data structures:
    - Advanced trees (AVL trees, red-black trees, B-trees): A few months
    - Advanced graphs (DAGs, minimum spanning trees, shortest path algorithms): A few months to a year
    - Hashing techniques (open addressing, chaining): A few months
    - Advanced string data structures (tries, suffix trees): A few months
4. Advanced algorithms:
    - Divide and conquer algorithms: A few months
    - Backtracking algorithms: A few months
    - Approximation algorithms: A few months
    - Network flow algorithms: A few months
    - NP-complete problems (and strategies for dealing with them): A year or more
