// One example of dynamic programming in ReactJS is the use of memoization, which is a technique for caching the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same function is called again with the same arguments. This can be useful for optimizing the rendering of React components that rely on expensive computations or complex data transformations.

import { useMemo } from 'react';

function ExpensiveComponent({ data }) {
    const processedData = useMemo(() => {
        // Perform expensive computation on data
        // ...
        return processedData;
    }, [data]);

    return <div>{processedData}</div>;
}
